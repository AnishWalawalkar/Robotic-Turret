# Robotic-Turret

C++ and RobotC code written to run a robotic turret that was build using Legos.
The turret has an automatic/manual mode. In automatic mode the turret uses a search algorithm to shoot down targets in a 30 cm radius. The turret is operated in manual mode with the help of a controller built using color and touch sensors.
