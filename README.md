# Robotic-Turret

C++ and RobotC code written to run a robotic turrent that was build using Legos. The turrent has an automatic/manual mode. In automatic mode the turrent uses a search algorithm to shoot down targets in a 30 cm radius. The turrent is operated in manual mode with the help of a controller built using color and touch sensors.
